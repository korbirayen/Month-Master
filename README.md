## About the Creator

Hi, I'm Rayen Korbi, the creator of Month Master. At 20 years old, I still sometimes struggle to remember the order of the months! It sounds silly, but it's true. That's why I created this app - to help myself and others master the months in a fun and interactive way. I hope you find it useful!
